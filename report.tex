\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

This document is part of a research project about software degradation
caused by careless developers' behavior and about strategies to deal
with such undesired behavior. These strategies will possibly be inspired
by concepts from game theory.

We assume that software degradation can be measured by the number and
the types of \textit{kludges} made by software developers in the code. A
kludge is code that

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Partially fixes a bug or partially implements a feature.
\end{enumerate}

\setlength{\parindent}{1.2cm}
\hangindent=1.2cm

The term partial can be understood as in \textit{partial functions}. A
partial function is undefined for some elements in the formal domain.
For instance, the square root function restricted to the integers:
\(f(25)\) is defined, but \(f(26)\) is undefined. In terms of features,
we can think about a developer calculating the point on which two lines
cross and neglecting the case of parallel lines

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  The developer knows that the code is only a partial solution, with
  high probability. \footnote{We need to study technical debt papers
  to enrich the conceptual background.}
\end{enumerate}

This project aims to study how software projects evolve in terms of
number and kinds of kludges. So far, we are trying to identify kludges
by looking at alerts generated by the PMD source code analyzer. PMD is
static source code analyzer that is commonly used to find possible
programming flaws. PMD is a good choice for a researcher to analyze bad
practices, because it supports multiple languages and it's very
flexible. It allows the researcher to provide his own rules for finding
interesting patterns in a source code in Java or other languages. These
are the planned steps for this research project:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Confirm the assumption that the frequency of PMD alerts is an accurate
  measure of the prevalence of kludges;
  
\item
  Confirm the assumption that kludges harm software development;

\item
  Confirm the assumption that there is a game in which, in Nash
  equilibrium, a developer chooses a strategy in which he gets personal
  benefits while causing harm to the project, by making kludges;

\item
  If all these assumptions are true, use mechanism design to devise how
  we can change the environment in a way that developers do not choose
  to make so much kludge, increasing the quality of the project in the
  long run.

\item
  Implement this mechanism building a plugin for a prominent CI tool,
  such as Travis or Jenkins or GitLab.
\end{itemize}

In this document, we evaluate PMD Source Code Alerts as proxies for
kludges. In section \ref{pmd}, we present PMD Source Code Analyzer and
show how we use the tool to generate alerts that are possible kludges.
We use this tool, also, to create a simplified AST that will help us in
the algorithm that infers how many new alerts were created, how many
were fixed and how many remain open in a transition from an old version
to a new version. This algorithm is described in Section \ref{alg}. In
Section \ref{results}, we compare the creation of new alerts with the
insertion of Self Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) comments.

\section{The PMD Source Code Analyzer}\label{pmd}

We use PMD to list the alerts that represent \textit{possible kludges}
in a source code. PMD receives a source code as input and generates a
list of bad programming practices contained in the code, i.e., the
alerts. The process we follow to generate the alerts using PMD source
code analyzer is discussed in Section \ref{history}.

PMD traverses the AST of a source code searching for violations of rules
which are configured by the user. PMD comes with a default rule set for
the Java programming language. The default rule set finds common
programming flaws such as unused variables, empty catch blocks,
unnecessary object creation, and so forth. It is possible to configure a
different set of rules by creating a custom XML file. In the source code
below, we can see a simple code and the alerts that were generated by
the default rule set of PMD alerts. In this example, PMD generates two
alerts of the type ControlStatementBraces (CSB), in lines 11 and 20.
This alerts means that there are no braces in a statement that is inside
a control statement.

\subsection{Using PMD to capture the history of alerts}\label{history}

To evaluate how the number of alerts evolved throughout the history of a
software project, we must be able to analyze a pair of different
versions of a source code (an old and a new version) and categorise each
alert contained in the code as either \textbf{new}, \textbf{fixed} or
\textbf{open}.

We define a PMD alert generated for the old version as either
\textbf{open} or \textbf{fixed} in the new version. An \textbf{open}
alert remains in the new version of the code. A \textbf{fixed} alert
does not exist in the new version.

A PMD alert generated for the new version is either \textbf{open} or
\textbf{new}. An \textbf{open} alert indicates that the same alert was
identified in the old version of the source code. A \textbf{new} alert
implies that the same alert cannot be identified in the old version.

The intersection between \textbf{fixed} alerts, \textbf{new} alerts and
\textbf{open} alerts is empty. The alerts identified as \textbf{open}
are equivalent in both new and old versions. To decide whether an alert
is \textbf{open}, \textbf{fixed} or \textbf{new}, one has to identify if
this alert in the old version is equivalent to its occurrence in the new
version. This document describes an algorithm to make this
classification.

\subsection{Using PMD to generate an simplified Abstract Syntax Tree }\label{ast}

In order to be able to categorise alerts in \textbf{new}, \textbf{open}
and \textbf{fixed}, we could match the lines of the old version to the
lines of the new version, using a diff functionality. Diff is useful but
is not sufficient. Frequently, the source code changes are more complex
than the ones we could address by using only diff. An alert \(o\) in the
old version could be essentially the same as the alert \(n\) contained
in the new version, but the piece of code where \(o\) resides could be
moved in a way that it´s impossible to match \(o\) and \(n\) only using
information from diff. Despite that, we can use extra information that
does not come directly from diff. The extra information used by the
algorithm described in Section \ref{alg} comes from a simplified AST
that we create using PMD Source Code Analyzer.

PMD traverses the source code visiting many different kinds of elements.
We do not use all the types of nodes recognized by PMD Alert to generate
the simplified AST because there are many kinds of nodes that are not
used in the algorithm described in Section\ref{alg}. If we used all the
kinds of nodes, we would end up with a tree that would not add value to
our analysis but would add complexity to our algorithm. The kinds of
elements that were selected are listed below:

\begin{itemize}


\item \textbf{Block}: a block of statements enclosed by braces;

\item \textbf{ClassOrInterfaceBody}: the body of an interface or a class, excluding the declaration;

\item \textbf{CompilationUnit}: the root of an AST tree;

\item \textbf{Method}: a method, including body and declaration;

\item \textbf{Constructor}: a constructor, including body and declaration;

\item \textbf{Statement}: any statement, like an if statement or an assignment;

\end{itemize}

PMD is prepared to receive an optional XML file, along with the Source
Code. This XML contain instructions about the alerts that must be
generated by PMD. The default XML generates alerts when it finds common
bad practices, but when we are recreating the simplified AST we are
describing here, we pass to PMD an XML file with instructions to
generate the all the nodes of the kinds we are interested in, which are
listed above. The PMD output lists these nodes and the location of these
nodes in the Source Code as we can see in Table \ref{tab_nodes}.

\normalsize

Looking at Table \ref{tab_nodes}, we see that there is information about
the location of the nodes, in terms of lines and columns. We can infer
which nodes are descendants of other nodes but we cannot see if the node
is a child or a grandchild (or a grandgrandchild\ldots). We follow three
steps to recreate the AST:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Link each element \(a\) to the set of elements \(X\) that are fully
  contained between the begin line / begin column and end line / end
  column of element \(a\). We can construct a directed graph in which
  the elements are the nodes and the links described are the edges. This
  is not a tree yet, because each node will have edges directed to all
  its descendants and not only its children in the AST.

\item
  Sort the nodes in the decreasing order of its number of children. The
  objective is to establish that, in a search through this graph, the
  first child chosen will be the one that is a child in the AST, and not
  only a descendant.

\item
  Proceed a deep-first search starting from the compilation unit node.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research questions}
\label{as_whole}

\noindent
\textbf{RQ: Is the frequency of PMD Alerts an accurate measure of the prevalence of kludges?}
\%\label{PMD_Kludge}

In a given transition between an old version and a new version we want
to identify if there was an intense introduction of PMD Alerts. To do
this we have to be able to categorise open, new and fixed PMD Alerts.

For each pair of an old and a new version of a source code, we can
measure the intensity of possible kludge introduction occurred. This
evidence of possible kludge introduction must be normalized by the size
of the change in source code between the two versions. We do this by
following this formula
\footnote{Another possibility is to use this formula \[ \frac{\#NewAlerts - \#FixedAlerts}{Change}    \], where Change can be a measure based on the differences betwwen the versions}:

\[ \frac{\#NewAlerts - \#FixedAlerts}{\#NewAlerts + \#FixedAlerts}    \]

With these version transition measured in terms of inclusion of PMD
alerts, we can try to correlate of these events with some other evidence
of kludge. In Section \ref{results} we calculate this correlation using
Self Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) comments

Other evidence could be churns around the location of the event in
subsequent commits. And this would be related with the statement 1 of
the definition of kludge in Section \ref{as_whole}.

Other possible evidence could be survey and bag of words mining of
issue, mailing lists, and commit messages showing evidence of kludge
game. This could be related more with the Statement 2 of the definition
of kludge in Section \ref{as_whole}.

\vspace{16px}

\noindent \textbf{RQ: Do kludges harm software development?}
\label{kludge_harm}

We need some way to measure degradation after a heavy introduction of
kludges. A drop in the popularity may not be a proper evidence. The
increment in the number of issues and bug fixed nor necessarily
represent a degradation. Churn could be used here.

\section{Algorithm to categorise alerts}\label{alg}

This Section discusses the algorithm to categorise alerts as open, fixed
or new. The algorithm uses the simplified AST described in Section
\ref{ast} to create features that help to infer if two alerts in
different versions must be considered the same or not. We use the term
feature as they are used in the field of statistical learning (Kuhn and
Johnson (2019)). In this field, the variables that are used to predict
the outcome of an event are called \emph{independent variables},
\emph{predictors} or \emph{features}. The term \emph{feature} is used
more appropriately when we are referring to a variable that is a
composite one or more variables, or the result of a treatment upon the
raw data. Given a pair of alerts, one from the old version and one from
the new version, we use the mapping between the lines of the old and the
new version and their ASTs as raw data to create the features that will
be used to infer if if they are the same alert. At this moment we use an
heuristic to infer if the pair of alerts is the same, as described in
Section \ref{heuristic}

\begin{center}
\smartdiagram[sequence diagram]{Get alerts for each version, Create AST for each version, Map new lines to old lines, Calculate features for each pair of new and old alert, Decide if same alert based on heuristic, Categorise alerts }
\end{center}

\subsection{An illustrative example}\label{source_used}

Throughout this Section \ref{alg}, we will consider the old and new
version of a source code as presented below. In the new version, the
alert generated in the line 11 of the old version was fixed, but another
one was not and remains on the new version. So we expect one alert Fixed
in the old version, one alert Open in the old version and another Open
alert in the new version.

\subsection{Get alerts for each version}

For the new and the old versions, we run PMD alerts using the default
rule set as described Section \ref{history}. Table \ref{old_alerts} is
created for the old version and Table \ref{new_alerts}, for the new
version.

\small

\subsection{Create AST for each version}

For each version of the source code the algorithm creates a simplified
AST as described in Section \ref{ast}.

In Figure \ref{AST_compare_id_alerts} we can see the ASTs for the old
and the new versions. In this figure, the numbers in the nodes are
meaningless and are presented only for reference.

\subsection{Map new lines to old lines}\label{map}

For each difference stated in the output of git diff (the sections of
the diff file starting with ``@@''), there is an indication of the
number of lines removed from the old version and the number of lines
added to the new one. The line in which the lines are removed from the
old version and the line at which the lines are added is indicated,
too.\textbackslash{} By using this information we create a relation
between the lines of the old version and the equivalent lines in the new
version. For the new and old versions presented in Section
\ref{source_used}, the relation is shown in Table \ref{table_map}.

\small

\begin{table}[H]

\subsection{Calculate features for each pair of new and old alert}

In the case of the source code we are using as an example, we calculate
features for \(2 \cdot 1 = 2\) combinations of new and old alerts, since
we have 2 old alerts and 1 new alert. The combinations for which the
features must be calculated are shown in Table \ref{combination}

\small

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-6}Combinations of new and old alerts for which the features must be calculated \label{combination}}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{r|l|r|l}
\hline

\hline
11 & ControlStatementBraces & 22 & ControlStatementBraces\\
\hline
20 & ControlStatementBraces & 22 & ControlStatementBraces\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\normalsize

We propose the following list of features to calculated for each
combination:

\subsubsection{Same Rule}

A boolean indicator that tells if the alerts are of the same type

\subsubsection{Same Group ID}\label{same_group_id}

A boolean indicator that tells if the alerts are equivalent in terms of
begin line and end line, considering the line map described in Section
\ref{map}.

For each combination, Table \ref{same_group} shows the begin line in the
old version, the corresponding begin line in the new version and the
begin line in the new version
\footnote{we suppress the end lines because for all alerts the begin lines and the old lines are the same}.
We can see that the alert that begins in line 20 of the old version
corresponds to the alert that begins in line 22 of the new version, so,
for this combination the feature ``Same group'' is true. For the other
combination, the feature ``Same Group ID'' is false.

\hline
20 & ControlStatementBraces & 22 & 22 & ControlStatementBraces & TRUE\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

\normalsize

\subsubsection {Same Method Group ID} \label{same_method_group_id}

A boolean indicator that tells if the alerts belong to methods that are
in the same group in the sense of the ``Same Group ID'' feature we
describe in Section \ref{same_group_id}.

First we find alert's method following the path from the alert´s node to
the root. The first node of the kind ``method'' or ``constructor'' found
in this path defines the alert's method. Considering the example we are
following, in Figure \ref{path_node_to_root_1} we can see the ASTs for
the first combination of alerts (see Table \ref{combination} ).

In this combination the method of the old alert is in node 5 of the left
tree and the method for the new alert is in node 4 of the right tree.
Table \ref{tab_same_method} shows that the begin and end lines of the
alert in the old version do not correspond to the lines in the new
version. The correspondence uses the map defined in the Section
\ref{map}. For this combination, the feature Same Method Group ID is
FALSE.

\small

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{report_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1} \caption{Abstract Syntax Tree. Nodes with the same number are equivalent \label{path_node_to_root_1}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-8}

\hline
End line & 15 & 17 & 27\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\normalsize

In Figure \ref{path_node_to_root_2} we can see the ASTs for the second
combination of alerts (see Table \ref{combination} ). In this
combination the method of the old alert is in node 3 of the left tree
and the method for the new alert is in node 4 of the right tree. Table
\ref{tab_same_method_2} shows that the begin and end lines of the alert
in the old version do correspond to the lines in the new version. The
correspondence uses the map defined in the Section \ref{map}. For this
combination, the feature Same Method Group ID is TRUE.

End line & 25 & 27 & 27\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\normalsize

\subsubsection {Same Method Name}

A boolean indicator that tells if the alerts were found in a method with
the same name. The methods for the alerts are found the way described in
Section \ref{same_method_group_id}, using the path from the node where
the alerts is to the root of the AST. Instead of the corresponding
lines, this feature evaluates the name of the methods. If the method
related to the old alerts and the method related to the new alert are
the same (even if the begin and end lines are not corresponding), then
the feature is TRUE.

\subsubsection {Same Block}

A boolean indicator that shows if the alerts belong to the same block.
The blocks are defined in a similar way than we do in Section
\ref{same_method_group_id}, following the path from the node where each
alert is until we find a node of one of this kinds: ``block'',
``method'' or ``constructor''. Then, the begin and end lines of the old
alert and the corresponding lines in the new version are compared with
the begin and end lines of the new alert, the same way we do in Section
\ref{same_method_group_id}.

\subsubsection {Same Code}

For this feature we compare the source code that is contained in the
nodes related to the alerts.

\subsubsection {Same Method Code}

For this feature we compare the source codes of the methods related to
the alerts. The methods related to the alerts are found the way we
describe in Section \ref{same_method_group_id}, following the path on
the AST from the node related to the alert to the root.

\subsubsection {Line distance}\label{line_distance}

Line distance is the distance between the ``mean line''
(\(\frac{beginline + endline}{2}\)) of the new alert and the
``corresponding mean line'' of the old alert. Table
\ref{tab_line_distance} shows the line distance for the combinations of
new and old alerts of the example we are following.

\subsection{Decide if same alert based on heuristic}\label{heuristic}

With the features at hand, we must decide if each combination of old and
new alerts refers to the same alert. At this moment we are using a rule
of thumb, or, in other word, an heuristic, to make this decision.

If all the boolean features are TRUE and Line Distance is equal to 0,
then the new and old alerts are declared the same

\[
\begin{aligned}
(SameRule \land \\
SameGroupID \land \\
SameMethodGroupID \land \\
SameMethodName \land \\
SameBlock \land \\
SameCode \land \\
SameMethodCode \land \\
LineDistance = 0 ) \\ \Rightarrow SameAlert
\end{aligned}\]

If Same Method Code is TRUE, then we consider it's the same method, even
if the name or the method is not the same. But if the method code is the
same, then the alert code and the kind of the alert must be the same. So

\[
\begin{aligned}
(SameRule \land \\
SameCode \land \\
SameMethodCode \land \\
\Rightarrow SameAlert
\end{aligned}\]

If it is the Same Group ID, then they are mapped to the same lines. If
this happens, the kind of alert is the same and one of the features
about the method is the same, then the new and old alerts are declared
the same.

\[
\begin{aligned}
(SameRule \land \\
(SameMethodCode \lor SameMethodGroup \lor SameMethodName) \land \\
SameGroupID)\\
\Rightarrow SameAlert
\end{aligned}\]

If it´s not the same group, then we must have evidence that the method
is the same and the line distance must be less then 5 lines, and the
rume must be the same

\[
\begin{aligned}
(SameRule \land \\
(SameMethodCode \lor SameMethodGroup \lor SameMethodName) \land \\
LineDistance < 5)\\
\Rightarrow SameAlert
\end{aligned}\]

If one of the rules above apply, the alerts are declared the same

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Categorise alerts}\label{heuristic}

Finally we can decide if the alerts in the old version are open or fixed
and if the alerts in the new version are open or new.

In our example, we have two alerts in the old version and they are
combined with the alert in the new version. Table
\ref{tab_categorizing_old} shows the two old alerts combined with the
new alert. The first old alert is not categorised as the same as any of
new alerts, so is categorised as Open. The second alert is categorised
as the same as the new alert, so is declared Fixed.

\section{Comparing new alerts with new SATD comments}\label{results}

In this section, we study the correlation between the creation of new
alerts and the insertion of new Self-Assured Technical Debt comments in
a transition between an old and a new version of source code.

We select some tagged versions of the project ArgoUML. For each pair of
sequential versions, we generate the PMD Alerts and categorise them in
New, Fixed and Open using the algorithm described in Section \ref{alg}.
We want to understand if the amount of new alerts, normalized by the
magnitude of the overall change between two versions, is a good proxy
for the amount of kludge introduced in the code base. A first approach
we try in this preliminary investigation is to measure the correlation
between the normalized amount of new alerts and comments that indicate
Self Admitted Technical Debt.

In Potdar and Shihab (2014), the authors discuss that the existence of
comments that contain some specific patterns may indicate what they call
Self-Admitted Technical Debts (SATD). In Sierra, Shihab, and Kamei
(2019), Self-Admitted Technical Debt is defined as the event in which
the developer consciously introduce debt. According to these two works,
the developer acknowledges the SATD in the form of comments. In Wehaibi
(2016) we can find some patterns based on the work of Potdar and Shihab.
For instance, some of these patterns are ``hack'', ``retarded'',
``remove this code'', ``treat this as a soft error'', ``kludge'',
``fixme'', ``this isn't quite right'', ``fix this crap'', ``abandon all
hope'' and ``kaboom''.

In this document, we selected some versions from the project ArgoUML and
extracted the PMD alerts, using the the procedure described in Section
\ref{alg}. Figure \ref{timeseries} shows three metrics related to the
transitions of versions.

In the first plot, ``Change'' tries to measure the amount of difference
between versions, summing the module of the difference between the
number of lines of code of new and old files:

\begin{equation} \label{eq_change} \sum_{f \in files}{|\#LoC_{f, new} - \#LoC_{f, old}|} \end{equation}

The second plot shows the number of new and fixed alerts, as categorised
by the algorithm in Section \ref{alg}.

The third plot shows the number of comments that contain expressions
listed in Wehaibi (2016). We categorise each comment as new, fixed and
open using a simple approach: if the text in the comment is the same,
the comments are classified as ``open'', the other ones are classified
as fixed, if they are in the old version and open if they are in the new
version.

\newpage

We try to measure if there is a correlation between the amount of new
alerts and the amount of new comments.

Figure \ref{scatter_prop} shows the relation between the proportion of
new alerts and the proportion of new comments:

\[PropNewAlerts = \frac{NewAlerts}{NewAlerts + OldAlerts}\]

\[PropNewComments = \frac{NewComments}{NewComments + OldComments}\]

We can see that there is a positive correlation.

\small

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{report_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{scatter_prop}Proportion of new alerts x Proportion of
new comments}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

In Figure \ref{scatter_diff} we correlate two metrics based on the
difference between the number of alerts and comments normalized by the
amount of change:

\[DiffNewAlerts = \frac{NewAlerts - OldAlerts}{Change}\]

\[DiffNewComments = \frac{NewComments - OldComments}{Change}\]

Where Change is calculated as in Equation \ref{eq_change}.

We can see that there is a positive correlation too.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{report_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{scatter_diff}Proportion of new alerts x Proportion of
new comments}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

It´s necessary to verify if the positive correlation that we found is
statistically significant. Table \ref{tab_reg} shows the results of
these regressions. In the form:

\[ NewAlertsProportion = \alpha + \beta NewCommentsProportions \]

and

\[ AlertsNormalizedDifferences = \alpha + \beta AlertsNormalizedDifferences \]

As we can see by the P-Value of the betas, we cannot reject the null
hypothesis in which there is no relation between comments and alerts.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-22}\label{tab_reg} Regression: alerts on comments}

\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l|l|l|l|l|l}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{ } & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Alerts Norm. Differences} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{New Alerts Proportions} \\
\cline{2-4} \cline{5-7}
Characteristic & Beta & 95\% CI & p-value & Beta & 95\% CI & p-value\\
\hline
(Intercept) & 0.34 & 0.17, 0.50 & <0.001 & -0.02 & -0.04, 0.00 & 0.045\\
\hline
New Comments Proportion & 0.22 & -0.01, 0.46 & 0.058 &  &  & \\
\hline
Comments Norm. Difference &  &  &  & 6.5 & -2.6, 16 & 0.16\\
\hline
\multicolumn{7}{l}{\textsuperscript{1} CI = Confidence Interval, CI = Confidence Interval}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\normalsize

In order to be able to reject the null hypothesis and accept that there
is a correlation between comments and alerts, we must run the same
procedures for more versions of the project and for more projects. We
can refine the way we select the comments, too. There are papers that
use more sofisticated schemes to identify SATD comments. These can be
our next steps.
